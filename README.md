# Udemy Course: Node with React - Fullstack Web Development
Course can be found [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/node-with-react-fullstack-web-development/).

Decided to take this course as it was one sale and covers OAuth through passport.js, which is something I've struggled to couple with React in the past.
